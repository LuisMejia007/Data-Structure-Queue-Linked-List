# Data-Structure-Queue-Linked-List
This was a lab done in university that deals with the data structure Queue. It was made with an implemented Linked List. 
The program starts with an item in the Queue being "dequeued" (deleted from the queue). 
The user then has the option to dequeue 1-9 items in the Queue.
